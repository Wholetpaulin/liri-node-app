### liri-node-app

This is a hand crafted, command line Siri clone.  Made with love <3... And node.js


### Instructions

1. Ensure you have node.js installed on your machine.  (This application also depends on npm's twitter, spotify, and inquirer packages sp make sure you get them all downloaded and in the same folder from this repo)

2. Format to run liri: node liri.js my-tweets      -------------    To read the 20 most recent tweets from liri
or: node liri.js spotify-this-song song_name       -------------    To see the artist, album, and song information for song_name
or: node liri.js movie-this movie_name             -------------    To see the actors, year, and movie information for movie_name
or: node liri.js do-what-it-says                   -------------    To read and execute one of the above commands from the random.txt file
